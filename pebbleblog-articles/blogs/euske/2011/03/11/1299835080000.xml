Holy shit. That was the longest tremor I've ever experienced. For those who don't know, a powerful earthquake hit Japan's east cost and there're a couple of pretty serious tsunamis. For me, luckily, after coming back home by bike, there wasn't that much of problem in my room except a few bookshelf rumblings. Other people were not as fortunate though, as they had to take a walk to their home. All the train systems in Tokyo area are still shut down. I saw streets crowded by those who were marching their long journey, which sometimes could take hours of travel. And while I'm writing this, things are still shaky every couple of minutes. And obviously, this entry has nothing to do with Lisp and S-exps, except it's still a perfect language to describe physical motion.
