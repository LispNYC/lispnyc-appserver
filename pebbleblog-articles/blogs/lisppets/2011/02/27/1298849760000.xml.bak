A good friend, Boyko Bantchev, has compiled
<a href="http://www.math.bas.bg/bantchev/links/people.html">a collection of personal web pages of computer scientists and mathematicians</a>;
among them are Abelson, Baker, Gabriel, Graham, Greenspun, McCarthy,
Norvig, Pitman, and Stallman (to mention just those who are directly
related to the topic of this site; there are many others equally or
more prominent).
