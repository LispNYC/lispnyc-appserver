<p>Before I really get started on posting blog entries for this, it was
imperative I figure out a way to blog from Emacs. Cause really, what
self-respecting Lisper blogs from a tiny text field in a web browser?
Madness.</p>

<p>So, if you also want or have a blog on this site and want to do it in
 emacs:</p>
<ol>
<li>go get <a href="https://launchpad.net/weblogger-el">weblogger.el</a>
 I just used ELPA, but there's a later version available.</li>
<li>Once you've got that loaded, do <code>M-x
 weblogger-setup-weblog</code>. When it asks you for the Server
 Endpoint, enter <code>http://www.lispnyc.org/blog/xmlrpc</code>. The
 other parameters (username, password, blog name) should be self
 explanatory.</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>

<p>There are some issues. Authentication is plaintext, I have to
manually type the entries in HTML. But it's still better than a web
form!</p>]]></body>

<p>I used a Chrome extension called 'Edit with Emacs'. &nbsp;It puts tiny edit&nbsp;buttons around all the text areas in Chrome. &nbsp;When you click on them,&nbsp;it brings up a new frame from your running Emacs session. &nbsp;You edit&nbsp;away, and when you're done, you type C-x s. &nbsp;I find this pretty useful&nbsp;in general, and it gets me far enough so that I don't feel I need&nbsp;stuff like weblogger.el.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>]]></body>
