<title>The Summer of Lisp rolls forward</title>

<excerpt/>
<body><![CDATA[
<p>So today is the day we finalize our application for Google Summer of
Code. Fingers crossed, next week I'll be able to blog about how after a
two year absence, LispNYC will have been accepted into the program. I
really hope we are, because the projects that are shaping up look great
and could go a long way in both helping the Lisp community and
burnishing its reputation. As a sometimes-computer-musician, I'm
particularly excited by the involvement of <a
href="http://project-overtone.org/">Project Overtone</a>. It looks like
David Liebke of <a href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a> is getting
involved as well.</p>

<p>We're also happy to announce additional support from our friends at <a
href="http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/solution-providers/brandorr/">Brandorr
Group</a>. To show their commitment to open-source, Brandorr has agreed
to offer a free Business Class Virtual Machine on Amazon Web Services
to any LispNYC students for use on their Summer of Code project.</p>]]></body>
