<body><![CDATA[<p>We're nearing our 10th year and this is the third major rewrite of LispNYC!&nbsp; The new site is sporting:</p>
<ul>
    <li>updated GUI</li>
    <li>dynamic updates from Meetup</li>
    <li><a href="http://lispnyc.org/blog-signup">blogs (get yours now!)</a></li>
    <li>SEO&nbsp;friendly</li>
    <li>backward compatible with our old landing points</li>
</ul>
<p>Being written in Clojure, it allows us to easily leverage the interals of our new blog system to display recent updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also behind the scenes, we're using Meetup's API to display the most recent meeting and Enlive for both templating AND&nbsp;parsing Meetup's API response.</p>
<p><strong>LispNYC goes to WAR</strong></p>
<p>The website is packaged as a Java <strong>W</strong>eb <strong>A</strong>pplication a<strong>R</strong>chive.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means LispNYC is <em>just another webapp</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's as simple as dropping it into a servlet container such as Tomcat or Jetty and watching it go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually the site is comprised of TWO webapps, one for the blog system and one for the main site, both happily working together.</p>
