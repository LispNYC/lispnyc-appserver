<p><span class="header">9 Nov 2010 - Hank Williams on The Death of the Relational Database</span></p>

<p>People have begun to realize the enormous gap between the
    relational database abstraction and the way people actually
    think about information. To be clear, I am not suggesting
    that relational databases will stop being used or that they
    are going to go away, but that developers are going to stop
    thinking of their data in relational database terms.
</p>
<p>Everyone from regular users to sophisticated developers
    thinks about information in a pretty simple way. There are
    objects, and there are connections or relationships between
    objects. For example if you have two objects, a cup and a
    table, the relationship between them might be "sitting on",
    indicating that the cup is sitting on the table. What makes
    this model so sturdy is that we can continuously add new
    objects: tables, cups, chairs, floors, table cloths,
    etc. And we can add infinite relationships, such as sitting
    on, sitting under, covering, etc. Computer scientists, and
    now, thanks to Facebook, everybody else, refers to this
    structure as a graph. </p>
<p>New data models such as the graph provide new ways to think
    about persisting data. The death of the relational database
    means the death of the relational database *abstraction* as
    a way that programmers think about data. What programmers
    need is to model data in the most natural way possible, and
    we are starting to see storage abstractions that are closer
    to how humans think instead of how computers need to. </p>
<p>Listen to Hank Williams describe his Lisp system that
    natively supports these higher level abstractions such
    as authorization, event notification and user-executable
    code inside the traditional domain of what used to be
    called "the database". </p>

<p><span class="header">21 Sep 2010 - AllegroGraph RDF Datastore Internals</span></p>

<p>Graph Databases have become a hot topic within the growing NoSQL 
movement because they provide Scalability, Flexibility, Social Network 
Analytics, Event Processing, GeoSpatial Reasoning, and more.</p>

<p>AllegroGraph has emerged as an industry leading high-performance, 
persistent graph database that scales beyond billions of triples. 
AllegroGraph provides unique Event Processing capabilities that are 
being incorporated into new Semantic Web applications such as Amdocs' 
AIDA platform.</p>

<p>Gary Warren King describes AllegroGraph's, path finding, Social 
Networking Analytics, GeoSpatial Reasoning and type inference details 
all of which work together in AllegroGraph's novel scalability strategy. 
There will be also be some speculative discussion about use cases for 
Google's July 2010 acquisition of the largest Semantic Technology 
Company - Metaweb/Freebase.</p>

<p><span class="header">10 Nov 2009 - Simple Scheme for Tricky Differentials</span></p>

<p>
Gershom Bazerman demonstrates an novel and elegant approach to modeling 
differential equations in functional languages.
</p>

<p>
Lazy splines can provide a clean way of expressing ordinary differential 
equations and deriving numeric solutions.  Unlike standard solvers, 
equations can be expressed simply and declaratively, as first class data 
in the target language (Scheme, Lisp, Haskell, etc.).  Differential 
equations can thus be turned directly into  easily readable and 
maintainable programs.
</p>

<p>Good turnout with about 30.</p>

<p><span class="header">8 April 2008 - DefDoc - TEX-inspired, Lisp-based document processing system</span></p>

<p>Lisp was originally designed for symbolic processing. Syntax
  manipulation is the most commonly used aspect of Lisp's symbolic
  processing capabilities currently.  The defmacro form provided by
  Common Lisp allows one to define new language forms which have full
  access to the symbolic information of the code within their
  bodies. Within the macro definiton, the entire facilities of the
  Common Lisp language may be used, including any other functions or
  macros you have defined.  This model is extremely powerful, and many
  advanced techniques for using it are explained in Paul Graham's book,
  "On Lisp" </p>

<p><span class="header">13 November 2007 - Clojure - A Dynamic Programming Language for the JVM</span></p>

<p>Rich Hickey presented the culmination of many years of work into his new dynamic lisp-like language.</p>

<p>Not only does it support a REPL, but everything is dynamically compiled into Java byte-code on the fly.  There really is no interpreter!</p>

<p>Besides performance, Clojure supports run-time polymorphism and an impressive take on making concurrent programming easy by the use of software transactional memory.</p>

<p>Almost 20 people attended, if you weren't one of them, then experience it online:</p>

<p><span class="header">13 Feb 2007 - Meta-Compilation of Language Abstractions</span></p>

<p>Pinku Surana presented his dissertation <i>"Meta-Compilation of Language Abstractions"</i> where he discussed the benefits of user-written compiler extensions.  This leads to simple APIs, optimizations, and the clean embedding of domain-specific languages.</p>

<p>It was one of those discussions that really makes you think outside the defmacro box, as he takes the idea and expands it's scope to include embedded DSLs.  Very cool indeed with almost 15 attendees.</p>

<p>Ken Tilton presented a live demo of his new product, an algebra tutor: The software is due to be released in three to six months, but the core 
capabilities are there and it was previewed at the Lisp-NYC.  Almost 30 people attended.</p>

<p>Review: Kenny, having been a teacher in the trenches of low-income school district, was in rare form.  His presentation was delivered in style and 
the crowd of geeks pushed the limits of his very impressive algerbra tutoring software.

<p><span class="header">11 May 2006 - Practical Common Lisp </span></p>

<p>Peter Seibel discusses his book &quot;Practical Common Lisp&quot; that was the #1 top selling Lisp book on Amazon, #2 in the Languages & Tools category, #4 in Programming, #11 in Computers & Internet, and #543 in all books.</p>

<p>Review: The meeting was great!  Peter is a very entertaining and engaging
speaker, his style isn't so much a prepared presentation, but rather a
story-telling one. </p>

<p>It was a good story too.  Although initially he talked about the
creation of his book, it naturally led off into tangents helped along
with audience participation.  He certainly has done his homework, is
very good at Lisp advocacy and his consulting background has helped in
weilding the all-powerful parens as a deadly weapon. :-)</p>

<p>Also, we managed to fill up Trinity as it was the largest attendence
we've ever had: 46 people!  Previous to that was Joel Spolsky.</p>

<p><span class="header">11 Apr 2006 - Social Gathering</span></p>
<p>Review: It was standing room only at the Westside Brewery, this is a good problem to have!</p>

<p><span class="header">14 March 2006 - nyclisp: An Urban(e) Lisp for the Lazy and Static</span></p>

<p> nyclisp (pronounced "Nice Lisp") is an interesting language
    falling squarely between Scheme and Common Lisp in it's
    avoidance of collisions when combining lazy evaluation and
    side-effects.<p>

<p>In a nutshell, it has:
<ul>
<li>13 primitives
<li>no special-forms
<li>both macros and types are first-class objects
<li>utilizes Algo-like thunking by separating argument handling from evaluation for function dispatch
</ul>
</p>

<p>This results in a language that is both more static AND more
    dynamic than both Common Lisp and Scheme.</p>

<p>Review: 20 people showed up for the intimate presentation which gave it a feeling of a workshop.  
Matt did well and got great feedback.</p>

<p><span class="header">14 Feb 2006 - Social Gathering</span></p>

<p>Let's put some LOVE into LispNYC.org's "I [heart] ()" logo!  Yes, bring
your special valentine over to Westside and enjoy romantic heart-warming
tales from the Lisp masters of love.</p>

<p>Geeks listened and brought their dates!</p>

<p><span class="header">10 Jan 2006 - The Hyperreal Dictionary of Mathematics, Part II </span></p>

<p>Joe Corneli, the "other half" of the HDM project, will
    demonstrate HDM's new hypertext and AI authoring tool
    Arxana, also known as "the scholium system".</p>
    
<p>Arxana is no ordinary hypertext tool, it draws heavily on
    the ideas from Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu combining them
    with an AI semantic network strategy and is implemented as a
    a GNU emacs package.</p>

<p>Aside from technical glitches, the presentation went well with about 15 people in attendance, most of them being math geeks.</p>

<p><span class="header">13 Dec 2005 - Holiday Party and Year Four Planning Session</span></p>

<p>Ok, with the amount of people that showed up and the new Symbolics 3620 Lisp Machine, it was definitely a "party". Although there was much ado about LispM with "what else can it do?" there were still plenty of arguments about linear functions.</p>

<p>With thanks to: Ray, Arcady, Stuart, Matt, Ben, Jay, Yusuke, Perry, Conrad, the Ladies of Lisp and many more which I'm sure I forgot!</p>

<p>Special thanks to Richard M. Stallman, leader of the free software world and Lisp hacker extraordinaire. He who epitomizes the hacker-ethic-of-olde and with whom I personally have a deep and powerful appreciation for, go Richard we need more of you.</p>

<p><span class="header">8 Nov 2005 - The Next Generation of Language Design and why Lisp is Relevant </span></p>

<p>Joel Spolsky of "Joel on Software" fame speaks on
    the next-generation of language design and why Lisp is
    relevant!</p>

<p>Joel's area of expertise while working at Microsoft area was
    "programmability" where he replaced the Excel macro language
    (XLMs) with Excel Basic and provided an object-oriented
    interface to Excel.  Excel Basic thus became "Visual Basic
    for Applications" and it's OO interface became knows as OLE
    Automation, a.k.a. IDispatch.</p>
    
<p>Joel has been writing about software development,
    management, and business the the CEO of Fog Creek Software
    and author of three books on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="header">13 Sep 2005 - How To Tell Stuff To A Computer,
          The Enigmatic Art of Knowledge Representation</span></p>

<p>Conrad Conrad Barski created this presentation in order to help demistify
    the science of knowledge representation (KR for short) for
    all who are interested in this still largely
    underappreciated scientific field. Representing knowledge,
    in itself, is not a very difficult thing to understand: It
    is no mystery that computers are a great way to store and
    retrieve information. But have you ever wondered where
    things currently stand with the science behind computer
    information?  Is the way we currently use information on
    computers about as good as it can be? ...Or, can we expect
    that there are major advancements still ahead of us?</p>

<p>Raymond Puzio presented his HDM project to a group of 30 people.  Although hi
s NJ bus was over an hour late on arrival, he managed to start after a mere 20 m
inute, which of course allowed us the opportunity for the practice Lisp Stand-up
, where Jay Sulzberger did an excellent historical perspective of Lisp.</p>

<p>Raymond's presentation was well received with the entire thing, including pre
sentation, done in Emacs.</p>
