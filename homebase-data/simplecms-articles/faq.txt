description: Frequenly Asked Questions for Summer of Code

*Do I have to be a student?* Students are the only ones who can implement the code.  If you are not a student you can formally participate as a mentor or informally as a domain-expert.

*Do I have to live in New York City?* No, you can live anywhere in the world.  If you do not live in New York, LispNYC tries to associate students and mentors in the same timezone.

*Do I need to speak English?* Yes, Google speaks English and the proposal must be in English.  If English is not your native tongue, LispNYC tries to match students and mentors based on native language.

*How does the process work?* A quick overview: First we solicit ideas from the community at large.  
Then LispNYC works closely with students to plan and create a great proposal.
Next we assign mentors and experts with the student proposals and submit the entire package to Google for funding.
If Google accepts the package, coding starts.  Details can be found in the <a href="/soc/student-responsibilities">Student's Rights and Responsibilities</a>

*Do I need to code in lisp?* Surprisingly: no.  Not every mentoring organization is accepted by Google, which is why LispNYC extends professional courtesy to equally-misunderstood functionally-oriented languages such as: Haskell, Dylan, etc.  Erlang and Smalltalk are included just because we like the way they roll.

*Do I need to propose something base on your ideas list?*  No.  They're just ideas to get you thinking, you can submit a proposal on anything.

*Will my proposal be funded?* Not all proposals are funded.  Good ideas along with a well worked-out proposal by an interested student stands significantly higher chance.  We're here to help you with that, please read the <a href="/soc/student-responsibilities">Student's Rights and Responsibilities</a>

*What is the student time requirement?* This is a summer job, it is expected to be near full-time work for the duration of the summer.

*What is the mentors time requirement?* Mentors should be prepared to spend 10 hours per week.

*How much will I get paid?* This is how it worked last year: If accepted, students are paid $4500 in two installments and mentors are paid $500 in one installment.
