description: Suggested proposal outline

[Starting March 28th, register](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/faqs) as a student with Google and submit a project proposal. Some helpful hints to think about when submitting your proposal to Google...


<p><span class="header">( what's in a proposal )</span></p>

Briefly, a proposal should more or less contain the following:

* Abstract
* Introduction - include community benefits
* Proposal Details
* Implementation Timeline - you get extra points for this!
* Short biography
* References - if any

At minimum you should have no less than two sentences per section. If your proposal is short it's best not to label or highlight the sections.

Do your homework - ping LispNYC if you have any questions, we're usually hanging around [#summeroflisp at irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/summeroflisp)

Use <a href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/">plain English</a>, even with technical papers.  It's much easier to read.

Use present tense whenever you can, past tense has a shelf-life.

Avoid using the first-person tense ("I", "me", "my").  This might
even feel painful in your bio so here is a short example:

> Doe, John - is the laboratory director of the Washington State of
> Investigation. He has more than 15 years of experience in bloodstain
> pattern analysis. John has been teaching classes in bloodstain pattern
> analysis for more than 8 years and has taught at forensic
> laboratories, universities and professional organizations in more than
> fourteen states and Canada. John is currently the chairmen of the IAI
> Bloodstain Pattern Identification Sub-Committee and is certified by
> the IAI as a Senior Crime Scene Analyst, Certified Bloodstain Pattern
> Examiner and a Certified Latent Print Examiner.

If you have a plan, break your deliverables down no smaller than 2-week
increments.

Keep the total application under 7500 characters in length.

Leave out unnecessary phrases and sentences:  *"...nobody
thought it would work, but by-golly the experiment ran correctly
the first time!"*

Spell check.

Remember: People read these and they have to read a LOT of them, be concise and keep it easy to read.

Good luck!
